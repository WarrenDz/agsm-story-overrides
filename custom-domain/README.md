# Custom domain
Esri provides an easy way for developers to host ArcGIS StoryMaps stories on their own domains. While users can't download the story's source code, they can use a simple script to change the URL from https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx to their organization's domain. This method allows authors to keep editing and updating their stories in the ArcGIS StoryMaps builder.

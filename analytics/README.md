### HTML customizations
Configuring these analytics platforms typically involves placing some script within the `<head>` of your webpage.

```html
<!-- Google Analytics Code -->
<!-- Replace {TAG_ID} -->
<script
  async
  src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id={TAG_ID}"
></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag() {
    dataLayer.push(arguments);
  }
  gtag("js", new Date());

  // Add TAG_ID here
  gtag("config", "{TAG_ID}");
</script>
<!-- END Google Analytics Code-->
```
